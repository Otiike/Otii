        <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Goshen Blessing was founded on 2021 just a year after the Covid-19 pandemic.
            The main objective for the formation of this organization is to reach out to
             the less vulnerable people in our Kenya society and God willing extend a further hand
             to the whole of East African Community. Our focus is majorly about the
             African Child <strong>“Mtoto Mwafrika”</strong>. This is by ensuring their educational needs 
            are catered for and their basic need like food and clothing which has quite not

        <h3>Achievements</h3>
        <P>We have managed to visit so far three childrens home. Our first Childrens home to visit was 
            the Lords servant Childrens Home located at Liyavo village, Kitale on August 2021.Our next 
            visit was a childrens home in Kakamega and our third visit was a childrens home at 
            Checkpoint, Webuye. We distributed to them school items to ensure easy learning for them. 
            Food and clothing. We also engage with them to hear and assist with some personal issues 
            they are going through as well as check on their mental wellbeing. We also engage with 
            them in some outdoor activities like playing games among others.<br><br>

            Apart from extending our hand to African children, we also visited the less fortunate families
             in Siaya and we shared with them food stuff and clothing. We were so happy to get their
              blessings.<br><br>
            We are looking forward to reaching out to as many children as we can and helping them with
             their physical challenges and needs and also their mental issues.
            </P>
